Thank you to all who came to the recent AGM , 35 were present a good turnout for what became a very busy meeting - in fact we ran out of time.

The committee remains largely the same, Sue Court has retired as Apiary Manager, but is still responsible for the Honey Show; Paula Gardner has retired as Vice Chair; that is one task we will need to complete, to replace her wisdom!

Thank you to people who have offered to help in the DDBKA apiary in the spring & summer.

Many of you have renewed your subscriptions for 2026, thank you. If you definitely want to lapse your membership for 2026, please email [doveranddistrictbeekeepers@gmail.com](mailto:doveranddistrictbeekeepers@gmail.com).

**Also, if you joined in 2025 & paid Local/Associate membership, once you have your own bees, then you must be Registered for insurance purposes.**
