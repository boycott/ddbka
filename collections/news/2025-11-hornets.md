In terms of preparation for 2026 we want to make sure of what members agreed at the AGM for future activity of DDBKA in the continuing battle we have with the Yellow-Legged Hornet.

Funding from Defra is not a given, Track & Trace is hard work, destruction of nests is expensive. If funding is withdrawn, Kent could have 17,000 nests.

Only strong bee colonies will survive, the rest are demoralised, the main predation is in August & September, the queens will be laying winter bees.

Nucs are particularly vulnerable. The gadgets to tackle this vary – Muzzles cost £30, Electronic Harps are £300.

There were 535 UK sightings, 21 queens captured, remember 95% of queens do NOT make viable nests. 160 nests destroyed.

There has been much hard work from our neighbours -Ashford, Canterbury, Thanet. SE & London need to work together. The nests are found particularly round the coast.

**DDBKA** - Q numbers are not doubling, increased monitoring & more public engagement are paying off, BUT 5 nests found after September 20th.

## CONCLUSION

The meeting voted overwhelmingly to support a commitment to 2026 trapping for 3 or 2 [min] weeks. Wind direction influences likelihood of a catch, hornets need to smell Trappit.

## Allocations for 2026

March to June -Spring trapping in homes & gardens
