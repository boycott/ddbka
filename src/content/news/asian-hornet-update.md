As the season winds down, we want to thank all members who have been vigilant in monitoring for Asian Hornets.

## Sightings

There have been a few confirmed sightings in the wider Kent area, but thankfully none directly in our immediate district this month. However, vigilance is still required.

### What to look for

Please continue to check your ivy patches on sunny days, as these are prime foraging spots for late-season hornets.

If you suspect a sighting, please report it immediately using the Asian Hornet Watch app or via our [reporting page](/hornets).
