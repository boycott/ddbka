Welcome to the brand new website for the Dover & District Beekeepers' Association!

We have rebuilt the site from the ground up to make it easier for you to find information about our meetings, membership, and beekeeping in the local area.

## What's New?

- **Mobile Friendly**: The site now works great on phones and tablets.
- **News Section**: Keep up to date with the latest announcements here.
- **Improved Navigation**: Find what you need faster.

We hope you enjoy the new site. If you have any feedback, please let us know via the contact page.
