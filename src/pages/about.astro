        Thanet BKA border us in the North, Canterbury and Ashford BKAs to the

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          The Dover and District Beekeepers' Association was formed at the
          beginning of World War Two from a former club of beekeepers, which had
          existed since World War One.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          We meet on the last Saturday of the month (except December). During
          the Autumn/Winter, we meet at Alkham Village Hall, during
          Spring/Summer, we meet at our Club apiary in Eythorne. Often a summer
          meeting will be held at a member's apiary, which gives members a
          chance to see someone else's set up. Each meeting includes
          refreshments and a raffle.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Our apiary meetings provide a chance for hands-on experience for
          beginners, and those who are considering the hobby. For other members,
          there are various talks available.
