            Local honey is not only delicious but may also offer health
            benefits. Many people believe that consuming local honey can help
            with seasonal allergies, as it contains small amounts of local
            pollen.

        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The flavour and colour of honey varies depending on the flowers the
          bees have visited. Kent's diverse landscape means our honey can range
          from light and delicate to rich and robust.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Common varieties from our area include spring blossom honey, summer
          wildflower honey, and late-season ivy honey. Each has its own unique
          character and taste.

          <p>
            Honey will keep indefinitely if stored properly. Keep it in a sealed
            container at room temperature, away from direct sunlight.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your honey crystallizes (becomes solid), this is completely
            natural. Simply place the jar in warm water and the honey will
            return to its liquid state.
