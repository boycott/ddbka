        A swarm is typically a rugby ball shaped cluster of bees hanging from a
        tree or fence. There are 250 species of bee in the UK but of these only
        honey bees swarm. Swarms usually occur from April through to September.
        Swarming is perfectly natural for honeybees and is the way colonies
        reproduce.
