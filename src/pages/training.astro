        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          This course covers all the key theory and practical points a competent
          beekeeper, at the start of their beekeeping career should be aware of.
          It aims to increase confidence and knowledge and in doing so improve
          bee welfare.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Participants must have kept at least one colony, for a minimum of 12
          months, without a break, by the time they take their assessment; such
          beekeepers will have experienced many of the points covered in the
          course.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          There is no obligation for members who attends the course to enter the
          BBKA assessment. This assessment usually takes place in late July or
          August.
